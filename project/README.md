Project
This will be the folder for the class project. 

The project for the class is to implement an algorithm for an application that you are interested in. Submit a two to five page summary,
describing the algorithm, the application, issues that arose in implementation, and data comparing benchmark performance (time taken, quality
of solutions found, or other measurement) to the theoretical analysis or
to competing approaches. Discuss the suitability of the algorithm to that
application. Is it what you would use? Why or why not?
